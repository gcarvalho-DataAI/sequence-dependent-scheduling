# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing the change or bug.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Keep changes focused and include context in the PR description.
4. If you add new functionality, include a small reproducible example or test.

## Development notes

- C++17 is required.
- OR-Tools is expected at `third_party/or-tools` (see `README.md`).
- Please avoid committing build artifacts, binaries, or local IDE settings.

## Code style

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer clear names over abbreviations.
- Add comments only when the intent is not obvious.
